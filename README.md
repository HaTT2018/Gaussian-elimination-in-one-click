# Gaussian-elimination-in-one-click

The code could be run in MATLAB, the file "GaussianElimination.m" finally generates a branch of LaTeX script, which is the entire process during Gaussian elimination. The inputs are A, b, and another coefficient ifLU. If "ifLU" equals 1 and A is a square matrix, the funciton will return the result of the LU factors. Elsewise, the function will return the Gaussion elimination process.

The file "Mat2LaTex.m" is a function that could help you transfer the matlab matrx to LaTeX codes, it considers the rational numbers but doesn't process irrational number.
